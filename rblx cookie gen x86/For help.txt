Download doesn't work?, it may be that you don't have Python yet. Download the latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/ then scroll down and press windows installer 64 bit or 32 bit if you on 32 bit ur must download it on 32 bit

and if it doesnt work eighter, just dm 7x7l on discord
